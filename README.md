ðŸŽ® What Your Code Does

Game Setup

The program starts by asking the player what board size they want (default is 7Ã—7, but it can be 3â€“25).

It then prints the rules and a scoring table that changes depending on the board size.

The player chooses Human vs Computer or Human vs Human.

If Human vs Computer â†’ asks if the human wants to play first (as White) or second (as Black).

Board Representation

The board is shown as a grid:

. = empty cell

W = white stone

B = black stone

Rows and columns are numbered so the player can type coordinates.

Example of an empty 5Ã—5:

   1 2 3 4 5
 1 . . . . .
 2 . . . . .
 3 . . . . .
 4 . . . . .
 5 . . . . .


Turns & Moves

White always plays first.

On each turn:

If itâ€™s a humanâ€™s turn, they type a move (e.g., 3 4 â†’ row 3, col 4).

If itâ€™s the computerâ€™s turn, the AI chooses a move automatically.

âœ… The AI isnâ€™t random â€” it tries to maximize immediate points from placing a stone, while avoiding giving the opponent a big scoring opportunity.
âœ… It also slightly prefers moves closer to the center (to simulate strategy).

Scoring System

Only straight lines (horizontal & vertical) matter.

Runs of less than 3 donâ€™t score anything.

Longer runs give rapidly increasing points, based on this formula:

Points(L, N) = round((L - 2)^(1 + N/10) * 2)


where L = run length, N = board size.

Example for N=7:

3 in a row â†’ small points

4 in a row â†’ much more

7 in a row â†’ very high score

(This mimics the steep scoring growth in traditional Pah-Tum).

Game End

The game ends when the board is full (all cells filled).

Final scores for White and Black are calculated and displayed.

The program declares:

"White wins!" if White has more points

"Black wins!" if Black has more points

"Draw!" if tied
